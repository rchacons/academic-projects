# Academic Projects

This repository contains various academic projects developed during my coursework and educational journey.

## Projects

### Rennes Public Transport App
An Android application for tracking and viewing schedules for the STAR public transportation system in Rennes. Features include downloading and processing GTFS data, offline access to transit information, and a user-friendly interface for viewing routes, stops, and timetables. Developed during my first year of Master's degree for the "Programmation mobile" (MOB) course.

**Technologies Used**: Kotlin, Android, Room Database, MVVM Architecture, Coroutines

### House Price Prediction Model
A machine learning project that implements various regression models to predict house prices based on multiple features. The project explores simple linear regression, multiple regression, feature selection techniques, and polynomial regression to achieve accurate price predictions. Developed during my first year of Master's degree for the "Méthodes de prévision à court terme" (MPC) course.

**Technologies Used**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels, Jupyter Notebook

### Differential Privacy Index
A Python implementation of PinedRQ, a differential privacy-preserving index for secure range queries on outsourced data in cloud environments. The project demonstrates how to implement encrypted data storage with privacy guarantees while maintaining the ability to perform efficient range queries. Developed during my first year of Master's degree for the "Sécurité des bases de données" (SBD) course in collaboration with Manh-Huan Nguyen ([manh-huan](https://github.com/manh-huan)) and Hugo Thomas ([HugoThoma](https://github.com/HugoThoma)). 

**Technologies Used**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, AES Encryption, Differential Privacy, Jupyter Notebook

### Support Ticket System
A comprehensive support ticket management system with a Java backend REST API and an Angular frontend. This project was developed as part of the "Systèmes d'Information Répartis" (SIR) class in collaboration with Manh-Huan Nguyen ([manh-huan](https://github.com/manh-huan)).

**Technologies Used**: Java, JAX-RS, Angular, TypeScript

### Train Station Concurrency Simulator
A Java-based concurrent programming project that simulates a train station with multiple trains, passengers, and platform management using thread synchronization and concurrency control. Features both console-based and REST API versions to demonstrate advanced concurrency concepts. Developed during my first year of Master's degree for the "Concurrence et coopération dans les systèmes et réseaux" (CSR) course.

**Technologies Used**: Java, Restlet Framework, Maven, Threading & Synchronization

### Angular Pokemon Explorer
An Angular-based web application that leverages the public PokéAPI to display a searchable list of Pokémon with detailed information about each one. Features a responsive UI built with Angular Material and demonstrates concepts like component interaction, services, and API integration.

**Technologies Used**: Angular, TypeScript, RxJS, REST API integration, Angular Material

[Go to project →](./angular-pokemon-explorer/)

### PHP Event Management Platform
A web application built with PHP using the MVC architecture for managing music events and artists. Features include artist profiles, event scheduling, media management, and an admin panel. Developed during my third year of Bachelor's degree for the "Programmation Web" (PW) course.

**Technologies Used**: PHP, MySQL, Custom MVC Framework, HTML/CSS/JavaScript

[Go to project →](./php-event-management-platform/)

### Java Tower Defense Game
A tower defense game built with Java that features multiple tower types, enemy units, and wave-based gameplay. The game includes resource management, tower upgrading, and various enemy types with different behaviors. Developed during my second year of Bachelor's degree for the "Programmation Objet" (PO) course.

**Technologies Used**: Java, StdDraw Library, Object-Oriented Design

## How to Use

Each project folder contains its own README with specific instructions on how to set up and run the project.

## Additional Academic Work

This repository represents only a subset of my academic projects. I've also completed several other projects, including:

- **Design Pattern Implementations**: Extensive work with Java design patterns including:
  - Creational patterns: Builder, Factory
  - Structural patterns: Adapter, Facade, Proxy
  - Behavioral patterns: Observer, Command, Memento, Strategy, Visitor
  - Concurrency patterns: Active Object, Producer/Consumer, RecursiveAction

These additional projects were maintained in my university's GitLab repository, to which I no longer have access. However, the experience gained from implementing these design patterns has built a strong foundation in my architectural approach to software development that I continue to leverage in my professional work today.
