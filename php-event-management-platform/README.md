# PHP Event Management Platform

A web application built with PHP using the MVC architecture for managing music events and artists. Developed as part of the "Progammation Web" university course during my third year of Bachelor's degree (L3).

## Project Overview

This platform was developed for "Anomic Elements," an organization that hosts electronic music events (particularly psytrance) and manages artists. The application provides administrators with tools to manage events, artists, and media content, while offering visitors information about upcoming events and artist profiles.

## Features

- **Artist Management**: Create, update, and display artist profiles with contact information, categories, and media
- **Event Management**: Schedule and manage events with detailed information including dates, capacity, and descriptions
- **User Authentication**: Admin login system with secure session handling
- **Media Management**: Upload and manage images for events and artists
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface for visitors

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: PHP with custom MVC architecture
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the MVC components
  - `controllers/`: PHP controllers for handling requests
  - `models/`: Data models and database interactions
  - `views/`: User interface templates
  - `core/`: Core application functionality
  - `config/`: Configuration files
- `public/`: Public-facing assets
  - `css/`: Stylesheets
  - `js/`: JavaScript files
  - `img/`: Image assets

## My Contribution

For this group project, my primary focus was on developing the backend functionality, including:

- Designing and implementing the MVC architecture
- Creating the database schema and SQL queries
- Building the controller logic for artist and event management
- Implementing the authentication system

The frontend design and implementation was primarily handled by my project partner.

## Learning Outcomes

This project allowed me to gain practical experience with:
- MVC architecture implementation in PHP
- Database design and SQL query optimization
- Session management and authentication
- PHP best practices and security considerations
